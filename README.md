## Testing
***
I made the page responsive using Chromes devtools, 5 Media queries and the website Am I responsive: http://ami.responsivedesign.is.
I tested the header logo, the nav links and the footer social media icons to make sure they work, I also made the form require a name and an email or else the form would not submit and tested this also.

### Valadator testing
+ I ran my HTML though the W3C validator and it returned no Errors
+ I ran my CSS through the offical (Jigsaw) validator and it returned no errors
### Accessibility
+ I got a 98% grade when i ran my code through Lighthouse in devtools
